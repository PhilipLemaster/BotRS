## Description
BotJS is a simple webapp designed to offer automation to repetitive farming tasks in OSRS. Currently featured are 3 unique bots which perform Woodcutting, Mining, and Fishing at predesignated locations. Functionality to track XP gained while using the bot for users who create an account on the app are in the finishing stages of development. More unique bots will likely be added at a later date.

## Installation Requirements
This app features multiple npm packages such as RobotJS, Passport, Express, BCrypt, and a few others. We are currently experiencing an issue with deploying the completed application to heroku, however the necessary packages can be required upon download of the code and the app works wonderfully on a local server.
***
## Usage
This app is available to be used by anyone interested in testing the bot. It is NOT advised to use on an active OSRS server, as this is against the OSRS terms of service and can render your account banned.
